## Reaper

Reaper Audio Workstation is a powerful digital audio workstation software for recording, editing, mixing and processing audio. It supports a wide range of features such as multitrack recording, audio processing, MIDI recording and mixing, and features a user-friendly interface and extensive plug-in support.Reaper also runs on multiple platforms, including operating systems such as Windows, Mac and Linux. Due to its flexibility and usefulness, Reaper is widely used in audio production, music production, film scoring and other fields.

Reaper's extension script is a programming tool used to customize and enhance Reaper's functionality. The following are some common types of Reaper extension scripts:

1. JS plug-in: JS plug-in is a plug-in that comes with Reaper based on the JavaScript scripting language, which can be used to create custom MIDI scripts, audio processing scripts, interface scripts, etc. Using the JS plug-in, users can customize some common operations, such as batch editing MIDI events, customizing complex automation curves, etc.
2. ReaScript: ReaScript is an extended script based on scripting languages such as Lua, Python and EEL, which can be used to write scripts for various custom functions such as batch exporting audio, batch renaming tracks, etc. ReaScript can also be used to access all the functions of Reaper by calling the Reaper API.
3. SWS extensions: SWS extensions are a set of plug-ins and scripts based on C++ and Lua scripting languages that can be used to enhance Reaper's functionality.SWS extensions include many useful features such as batch moving and copying audio, multi-channel batch mixing, etc.
4. Custom Actions: Custom Actions is a feature for creating custom actions, which can be used to customize various common actions, shortcuts, menus, etc. With custom actions, users can quickly access frequently used actions and increase productivity.

In short, Reaper's extension scripts are very flexible and powerful and can be used to implement various custom functions and actions. Users can choose the appropriate extension scripts according to their needs and use them to increase their productivity and creativity.

## ReaScript

ReaScript is a scripting language used to automate various tasks and process audio in the Reaper Audio Workstation. It is part of Reaper and can be written in Lua, Python and EEL (a C++ style scripting language). Here are some of the features of ReaScript:

1. Access and control Reaper's API functions: ReaScript allows scripts to access Reaper's API functions for various functions, such as setting the start position of the project timeline, adding new tracks, etc. Documentation for the API functions can be found in the Reaper user manual.
2. Handling MIDI data: ReaScript supports handling MIDI data, including changing note and controller events, adding and removing MIDI tracks, etc. Documentation for the MIDI functions can be found in the Reaper user manual.
3. Handling audio data: ReaScript supports handling audio data, including changing audio clips, mixing and FX processing, etc. Documentation for the audio functions can be found in the Reaper user manual. Documentation for the audio functions can be found in the Reaper User Manual.
4. Plug-in extensions: ReaScript allows scripts to create plug-in extensions to extend Reaper's functionality. Plug-in extensions can add new menus, toolbar buttons, actions, FX, etc. Documentation for plug-in extensions can be found in the Reaper user manual. 5.
5. Custom Interface: ReaScript supports the creation of custom interface elements, such as buttons, sliders, text boxes, etc. These interface elements can be used with API functions and other scripting features to create interactive scripts.
6. Timers: ReaScript supports the creation of timers to perform actions at certain time intervals. Timers can be used to implement automated or periodic tasks.
7. Data Storage and Recovery: ReaScript allows scripts to store data in a Reaper project for later use. Data can be stored in project files, saved in Reaper's INI files, or using temporary files from the OS.
8. System Interaction: ReaScript supports interaction with the OS, including file system access, network communication, system dialogs, etc.
9. Interaction with external devices: ReaScript supports interaction with external devices, such as MIDI controllers and OSC devices, for more advanced automation and control.
10. Help documentation and sample scripts: ReaScript comes with complete help documentation, including detailed descriptions of API functions and sample scripts. These sample scripts help new users get started and provide more inspiration and sample code for experienced users.
11. Interoperability with other scripting languages: ReaScript supports interaction with other scripting languages (such as Lua and Python) for more advanced automated tasks and workflows.
12. Extensibility and customization: ReaScript's flexibility and extensibility make it the scripting language of choice for Reaper users. Users can create custom functions and classes as needed to achieve more advanced automation tasks and functionality.
13. Compatibility: ReaScript scripts run on Windows, Mac and Linux, and can be run in both 32-bit and 64-bit versions of Reaper. This compatibility makes ReaScript a cross-platform automation tool.

In summary, ReaScript is a powerful, flexible and extensible scripting language that provides Reaper users with a wide range of automation features and workflows. Whether you are a beginner or an experienced user, ReaScript can help you use Reaper more effectively for a variety of tasks.
